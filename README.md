## Project Description:
For your AP course project, you will be tasked with implementing a game inspired by Stick Hero using JavaFX and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. Your game should emulate the core mechanics of Stick Hero while adding your own creative twist. This document provides the necessary guidelines for your project.

In this project, you will develop a game where a stick-hero character travels between platforms using a stick. The stick must be of exact length, or the character will fall. The character can pick up collectibles while reaching the goal. 

## JUnit Tests:
ImageNull
PathCheck
UniqueSprite
OnlyOneCharacter

## Design Patterns:
Singleton Design Pattern - Sprite Class
Flyweight Design Pattern - Music Class

## Bonus Aspects:
Music Class - we added sound effects
Character Skins - there are various skins you can choose from for your sprite
Multithreading is implemented
Stick growth rate increases as the game progresses

## Assumptions, Pointers, General Instructions:
The music files for coin collection and death will only be played once.
The stick-hero (and other game elements) may be partially or fully out of the screen's bounds.
The coin collection is sensitive. If the bandana only touches, then the coin will not be collected
